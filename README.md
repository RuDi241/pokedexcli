## üßÆ Catch Probability

The chance to catch a Pok√©mon is based on the following formula:

```
catch probability = (pokemonCatchChanceMultiplier) / log(baseExperience + 2)
```

Default value:

```
pokemonCatchChanceMultiplier = 2.5
```

If the probability exceeds a random threshold, the Pok√©mon is caught and added to your Pok√©dex.
